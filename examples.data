I think it's always best to just have the object type in both <> when creating a list object.

Off topic: have you guys checked out the Java 8 foreach on lists? Pretty good for saving time.
PHP Code:
***CODE***[list.forEach(System.out::println); ]***CODE***
Cool stuff.===LINESPLIT===Hmmm my IDE was set at a lower code level :/ but either way I have no idea how to play this version of minesweeper....===LINESPLIT===I think that if you have Java 6 and use the type only in the declaration it wont work iirc. You'd need the types in the declarations and value like this:

Code:
***CODE***[List<Object> list = new ArrayList<Object>();]***CODE***
Java 7 added the feature to do it this way(iirc not sure)

Code:
***CODE***[List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();]***CODE***

I'm not sure though I might be an idiot but I think that's how it works.
Cba to check your code & look it up on the interwebs since I'm on my phone.

Daniel Liang (Comprehensive Version)

It's a really useful, easy-to-understand and joyful-to-read book for JAVA beginner and intermediate learning. I've been using this book as a main Java book since the beginning. you can find the torrent on kat.ph===LINESPLIT===Java 7 is version 51 and Java 8 is 52 iirc. If you want to load a class(in this case your plugin) that is compiled with Java 8's compiler and want to run it on a Java 7 JVM it won't work as the jvm doesn't support Java 8.===LINESPLIT===The newer features provide minimal performance increases while decreasing the languages readability arbitrarily. Unless you require a specific feature from another version you should always compile for the lowest version you need. For instance non-numerical switch statements are Java 7 I believe (and should be avoided in any high performance code). I personally prefer running pre 1.4 for the ability to code golf without a main.===LINESPLIT===Yeah it is a shame they should really utilize all the new features of Java.===LINESPLIT===***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=43003218#pid43003218]***CITING***

There is a reason why they allowed a more simplistic way to loop through lists.

forEach loop = 3 lines or more

forEach method = 1 line

Of course, it's not always about the size (length in lines) of the code.===LINESPLIT===***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=42106947#pid42106947]***CITING***

Java hasn't changed that much. The only additional things that have been added are not very life changing syntax.===LINESPLIT===If you have no delay in the loop it will constantly do the action and thus freeze the main UI thread. Create a separate thread to do the action:

Once the user has selected what they want the timer to count down in for example  hours, minutes or seconds they can then enter a number input.Text so if they enter 30 and the seconds RadioButton checked it will be a 30sec timer select Minutes its then a 30 minute timer. So the start time can be anything the user wants really.

There is also 4 of these that all run at the same time.
